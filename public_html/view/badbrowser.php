<h2><?= $browser; ?>, seriously?</h2>

<p>sorry, but your browser wont quite work with this site. do yourself a favor and <a href="http://firefox.com">go get firefox</a></p>

<p>there's plenty of other browsers out there too, we just like firefox the best.</p>

<p>if thats not your cup of tea, try <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">safari</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">opera</a>, or at the very least <a href="">internet explorer 7</a></p>
