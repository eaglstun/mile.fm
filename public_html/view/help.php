<p>MILE.fm is exactly one mile of pictures, at 72 dots per inch (dpi), from users just like you!</p>

<p>Click and drag to move around.  When you see an image you like, double click on it.</p>

<p>From there, you can vote on the image by giving a thumbs up or down.  
You can also comment on the image, or tag it with descriptive words.</p>

<p>The map in the lower left shows where you are within the Mile.  You can zoom in and out here.</p>
